I'm a postoctoral researcher at the Data Systems Group at MIT CSAIL, working with [Sam Madden](https://db.csail.mit.edu/madden/) and [Michael Cafarella](https://people.csail.mit.edu/michjc/).

I'm interested in developing AI applications, and the underlying system abstractions to help enable this next generation of great AI applications.  I focus on problems around the data needed for AI: ie, raw data, human annotations, model outputs, model artifacts, indices, etc, and on solutions mixing algorithmic insights (eg. clever sampling techniques, human-in-the-loop interactive retrieval algorithms, applying deep neural nets) with system-building. I enjoy working on tough problems with great people.

Before grad school, I worked as a software engineer at AWS on the Amazon Aurora DB team; specifically on its innovative, disaggregated DB log-storage component.

In my spare time I enjoy hiking and sight seeing in New Hampshire and Maine, running leisurly along the Charles in Cambridge, and lately strength training the basic four lifts. I am originally from, and grew up in [Cob√°n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cob%C3%A1n), a town in northern Guatemala. I am also a [Li Po Chun United World College](https://www.lpcuwc.edu.hk/) alum, and a Guatemalan science olympiad alum.
