I'm a postoctoral researcher at the [Data Systems Group](https://dsg.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT CSAIL, working with [Sam Madden](https://db.csail.mit.edu/madden/) and [Michael Cafarella](https://people.csail.mit.edu/michjc/). I enjoy working on tough problems with great people.

I am currently in the job market looking to work on machine learning model development, especially language and vision-language models on impactful real-world deployments.

My expertise spans applied machine learning work during graduate school and data-systems work in industry prior to grad school. During my PhD, also here at the MIT Data Systems group, I focused on problems around the data needed for developing AI applications, such as the need for retrieval from large databases of video and images.  Solutions I developed mixed algorithmic insights (eg. clever sampling techniques, human-in-the-loop interactive retrieval algorithms, supervised and semi-supervised learning techniques) with system-building and implementation work. To know more about my work, you can take a look at the selected publications below.

Before grad school, I worked as a software engineer at Amazon Web Services, on the [Amazon Aurora DB](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3035918.3056101) team, specifically on its innovative cloud storage component.

In my spare time I enjoy hiking and sight seeing in New Hampshire and Maine with the [MIT outing club](https://mitoc.mit.edu/), running along the Charles in Cambridge, and lately strength training the basic four lifts. I am originally from [Cob√°n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cob%C3%A1n), a city in northern Guatemala. I am also a [Li Po Chun United World College](https://www.lpcuwc.edu.hk/) high-school alum, a Guatemalan science olympiad alum, and an alum of American School of Guatemala's PBA scholarship program.
