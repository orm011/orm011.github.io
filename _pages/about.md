I'm a postoctoral researcher at the [Data Systems Group](https://dsg.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT CSAIL, working with [Sam Madden](https://db.csail.mit.edu/madden/) and [Michael Cafarella](https://people.csail.mit.edu/michjc/). I enjoy working on tough problems with great people.

I'm interested in the underlying system abstractions that will enable this next generation of great AI applications.  I focus on problems around the data needed for AI: ie, raw data, human annotations, model outputs, model artifacts, indices, etc, and on solutions mixing algorithmic insights (eg. clever sampling techniques, human-in-the-loop interactive retrieval algorithms, applying deep neural nets and other machine learning techniques) with system-building.

Before grad school, I worked as a software engineer at Amazon Web Services, on the [Amazon Aurora DB](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3035918.3056101) team; specifically on its innovative, disaggregated cloud storage component.

In my spare time I enjoy hiking and sight seeing in New Hampshire and Maine with the [MIT outing club](https://mitoc.mit.edu/), running along the Charles in Cambridge, and lately strength training the basic four lifts. I am originally from, and grew up in [Cob√°n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cob%C3%A1n), a town in northern Guatemala. I am also a [Li Po Chun United World College](https://www.lpcuwc.edu.hk/) alum, and a Guatemalan science olympiad alum.
